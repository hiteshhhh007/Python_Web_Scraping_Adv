# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup (An Advanced Project)
This is another Web Scraping project which scrapes the GitHub Website. It crawls throughout the website and gives us the top repositories from each of the most _in-demand_ topics currently in GitHub. For each topic, **it gives us the name of the repositories, its link, the owner name and the stars it has got to its name till now**.
It creates a seperate folder, wherein a excel file for each of the topic is created having the above mentioned parameters.

Below is a video which demonstrates the creation of a seperate file along with excel files for all the topics.
